The next day, Ip and Cheung are invited by Tin to his home for tea. Tin praises them for their martial arts abilities and tells them that he has nominated them to be his successors as the chairman of the Hong Kong Martial Arts Association. He also reveals that he is terminally ill and does not have much time left. Ip and Cheung are both reluctant to accept the offer, but Tin insists that they attend a ceremony at a restaurant where he will announce his decision.
 
Meanwhile, Frank is dissatisfied with Ma's slow progress and decides to take matters into his own hands. He goes to the school with a group of armed men and demands that the headmaster sign over the property. Ip arrives with his students and confronts Frank, who challenges him to a three-minute fight. Ip accepts and they exchange blows in an intense match. Ip manages to hold his own against Frank's powerful punches, but the fight is interrupted when the police arrive. Frank escapes with Ma and his men, while Ip and the headmaster are arrested by Fat Po for their own protection.
 
At the restaurant, Tin announces that he has chosen Ip as his successor, much to Cheung's disappointment and anger. Cheung feels that he deserves the title more than Ip, who he considers an outsider and a rival. He challenges Ip to a fight to prove himself, but Ip declines, saying that he has no interest in fame or power. Cheung accuses Ip of being afraid and storms out of the restaurant.
 
Ip is released from custody and returns home, where he finds out that his wife's condition has worsened. She has been diagnosed with cancer and has only a few months left to live. Ip is devastated by the news and vows to spend more time with her. He also decides to quit martial arts and focus on his family.
 
Cheung, on the other hand, becomes more obsessed with surpassing Ip. He joins forces with Ma and Frank, who offer him money and support in exchange for his loyalty. Cheung agrees to help them take over the school and defeat Ip once and for all.
 
One night, Cheung leads a group of thugs to attack Ip's house, where they set fire to it and injure Ip's son. Ip arrives in time to save his son and fights off the attackers. He recognizes Cheung among them and realizes that he has betrayed him. He chases after Cheung, but loses him in the streets.
 
Ip takes his son to the hospital, where he meets Miss Wong, who has been taking care of him. She tells him that she admires him for his courage and kindness, and that she has feelings for him. Ip thanks her for her help, but tells her that he loves his wife and cannot reciprocate her feelings.
 
Ip then goes to see Tin at his home, where he finds him dead on his bed. He also finds a letter from Tin, who apologizes for causing trouble between him and Cheung. He explains that he chose Ip as his successor because he saw in him a true martial artist who follows the principles of Wing Chun: humility, compassion, and righteousness. He also warns him about Cheung's alliance with Ma and Frank, and urges him to stop them before they cause more harm.
 
Ip decides to honor Tin's wish and confronts Cheung at his dojo. He challenges him to a duel on a wooden platform surrounded by blades, where the loser will fall off and die. Cheung accepts and they engage in a fierce fight. They are evenly matched in skill and speed, but Ip has an edge in experience and wisdom. He eventually knocks Cheung off the platform, but catches him before he falls onto the blades. He tells him that he does not want to kill him, but only wants him to realize his mistake.
 
Cheung admits defeat and apologizes to Ip for his actions. He says that he was blinded by jealousy and ambition, and that he lost sight of what Wing Chun truly means. He asks Ip for forgiveness and promises to change his ways.
 
Ip accepts Cheung's apology and helps him up. They are then surrounded by Ma and Frank's men, who have come to finish them off. Ip and Cheung team up to fight them off, using their Wing Chun skills to overcome their numbers.
